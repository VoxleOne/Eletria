# Beam Pair: The Fundamental Unit of Voxel Activation

In Eletria, voxel activation depends on the precise **intersection of two electron beams**. This requirement leads to the definition of a key architectural concept:

> **Beam Pair (BP)** — A synchronized pair of electron beams that intersect at a voxel location to trigger visible photon emission.

This document introduces the Beam Pair as the primary unit of 3D voxel rendering and discusses how this concept enables scalability, parallelization, and future expansion of the Eletria system.

---

## Definition

A **Beam Pair** consists of:

- **Two independently directed electron beams**, labeled A and B,
- Steered by high-speed gimbals (or equivalent actuation),
- Coordinated temporally and spatially by the **SpinStep** engine,
- Targeted to intersect at a voxel coordinate \( \vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \),
- With combined energy sufficient to induce photon emission via recombination.

Each Beam Pair can activate **one voxel at a time**.

---

## Role in the System

The voxel field is not generated by a single continuous beam or even two beams in isolation, but rather by **multiple, intelligently coordinated Beam Pairs**. Depending on the application, a system may operate:

- With a **single Beam Pair**: For prototyping or serial voxel refresh.
- With **multiple Beam Pairs**: For parallel voxel generation or high-speed refresh cycles.

## Scaling with Beam Pairs

### Performance Implications

| Beam Pairs (BP) | Voxel Throughput (per frame) | Use Case |
|------------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| 1 BP             | 1 voxel at a time              | Proof-of-concept |
| 2 BPs            | 2 concurrent voxels            | Stereoscopic test |
| 4–8 BPs          | Parallel voxel field           | Basic image rendering |
| 16+ BPs          | High-resolution volumetrics    | Real-time 3D display |

### Parallelism

Beam Pairs can be **statically assigned** (each to a voxel grid region), or **dynamically reassigned** frame-by-frame using time-division multiplexing. This allows for:

- Improved refresh rate,
- Reduced gimbal travel distances,
- Local voxel clusters rendered in parallel.

---

## Control Logic

Each Beam Pair operates under the control of the **SpinStep engine**, which calculates:

- Trajectory angles for both beams,
- Gimbal quaternion updates for steering,
- Firing schedules (timing, duration, energy),
- Optional pre-clearing (e.g. IR laser path clearing).

The voxel is activated **only when both beams from the pair intersect at the correct point, at the same time, with matching pulse energy**.

---

## Hardware Implications

Each Beam Pair requires:

- Two gimbal-controlled beam nozzles (or deflectors),
- Electron emission sources (likely shared),
- Pulse control and modulation,
- Optional paired IR laser for ion path clearing,
- Tight spatial alignment and time synchronization.

Systems with many Beam Pairs may benefit from:

- Shared vacuum environment,
- Cross-pair calibration systems,
- Centralized or distributed SpinStep control instances.

---

## Toward Modular Beam-Pair Arrays

The Eletria system architecture can evolve toward **modular beam-pair arrays**, where:

- Each module contains multiple Beam Pairs,
- Modules can be added to scale resolution or field size,
- Communication between modules is coordinated through SpinStep.

---

## Summary

> Beam Pairs are the fundamental voxel-producing unit in Eletria.

They offer:

- Spatial targeting precision,
- Time-coordinated energy delivery,
- Scalable hardware design,
- Performance tuning via parallelism.

Future developments will extend this concept toward **adaptive beam-pair grids**, optimized voxel refresh paths, and dynamic voxel routing.
