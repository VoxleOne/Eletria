### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Important Note:** This project explores an experimental concept based on electron beam pair interactions. Subsequent analysis has revealed that some underlying assumptions may not hold, casting doubt on the viability of this specific approach.

Despite this, the repository remains public for the following reasons:

* It serves as a working example of our advanced graph traversal engine, **Spinstep**, which was developed in tandem with this project.
* It offers a resource for developers, researchers, and curious minds to engage with both the conceptual framework and the software.
* It promotes open sharing of ideas as an alternative to proprietary or patent-restricted models.

We are actively developing a revised implementation that incorporates laser-based components alongside electron beams. This new direction appears more promising and will be published soon.
