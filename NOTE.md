### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Important Note:** This project explores an experimental concept based on electron beam pair interactions. Subsequent analysis has revealed that some underlying assumptions — particularly those concerning beam intersection — may not hold, casting doubt on the viability of this specific approach.

Despite this, the repository remains public for the following reasons:

* It serves as a working example of our advanced graph traversal engine, [**Spinstep**](https://github.com/VoxLeone/SpinStep/tree/main), which was developed in tandem with this project.
* It offers a resource for developers, researchers, and curious minds to engage with both the conceptual framework and the software.
* It promotes open sharing of ideas as an alternative to proprietary or patent-restricted models.

We are actively developing a revised implementation that incorporates laser-based components alongside electron beams. This new direction appears more promising and will be published soon.
